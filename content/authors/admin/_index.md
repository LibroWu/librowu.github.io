Hi! I am Yexin Wu (吴叶鑫, [jɛɕin wu]), a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu/)(UIUC), advised by [Prof. Jiaxuan You](https://cs.stanford.edu/~jiaxuan/). Previously, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate period, I had the privilege of collaborating with Asst. Prof. [Zhuosheng Zhang](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/zhangzs/) and Prof. [Hai Zhao](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhaohai/) at [BCMI Lab](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/), focusing on Chain-of-Thought generation.

My research interests lie in:

- **AI Agents**: I aim to design AI agents that can interact with humans, serving as powerful assistants.
- **Large Language Models(LLMs)**: I am interested in measuring LLMs' capability and leveraging LLMs to build powerful systems.
- **Interpretability**: I am intrigued by the quest to unravel the origins of the enchanting capabilities of language models.
